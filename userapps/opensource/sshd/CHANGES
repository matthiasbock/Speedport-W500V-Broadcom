- Fix uninitialised temporary variable in DSS signing code
  (thanks to Matthew Franz <mdfranz at io.com> for reporting, and the authors
  of Valgrind for making it easy to track down)
- Fix remote version-string parsing error
  (thanks to Bernard Blackham <bernard at blackham.com.au> for noticing)
- Improved host-algorithm-matching algorithm in algo.c
- Decreased MAX_STRING_LEN to a more realistic value
- Fix incorrect version (0.34) in this CHANGES file for the previous release.

0.35 - Sun August 17 2003 05:37:47 +0800

  (thanks to Joel Eriksson <je at bitnux.com>)

0.34 - Fri August 15 2003 15:10:00 +0800

- Made syslog optional, both at compile time and as a compile option
  (suggested by Laurent Bercot <ska at skarnet.org>)
- Fixup for bad base64 parsing in authorized_keys
  (noticed by Davyd Madeley <davyd at zdlcomputing.com>)
- Added initial tcp forwarding code, only -L (local) at this stage
- Improved "make install" with DESTDIR and changing ownership seperately,
  don't check for setpgrp on Linux for crosscompiling.
  (from Erik Andersen <andersen at codepoet.org>)
- More commenting, fix minor compile warnings, make return values more
  consistent etc
- Various signedness fixes
- Can listen on multiple ports
- added option to disable openpty with configure script,
  (from K.-P. Kirchdörfer <kapeka at epost.de>)
- Various cleanups to bignum code
  (thanks to Tom St Denis <tomstdenis at iahu.ca>)
- Fix compile error when disabling RSA
  (from Marc Kleine-Budde <kleine-budde at gmx.de>)
- Other cleanups, splitting large functions for packet and kex handling etc

0.33 - Sun June 22 2003 22:24:12 +0800

- Fixed some invalid assertions in the channel code, fixing the server dying
  when forwarding X11 connections.
- Add dropbearconvert to convert to/from OpenSSH host keys and Dropbear keys
- RSA keys now keep p and q parameters for compatibility -- old Dropbear keys
  still work, but can't be converted to OpenSSH etc.
- Debian packaging directory added, thanks to Grahame (grahame@angrygoats.net)
- 'install' target added to the makefile
- general tidying, improve consistency of functions etc
- If RSA or DSS hostkeys don't exist, that algorithm won't be used.
- Improved RSA and DSS key generation, more efficient and fixed some minor bugs
  (thanks to Tom St Denis for the advice)
- Merged new versions of LibTomCrypt (0.86) and LibTomMath (0.21)

0.32 - Sat May 24 2003 12:44:11 +0800

- Don't compile unused code from libtomcrypt (test vectors etc)
- Updated to libtommath 0.17 and libtomcrypt 0.83. New libtommath results
  in smaller binary size, due to not linking unrequired code
- X11 forwarding added
- Agent forwarding added (for OpenSSH.com ssh client/agent)
- Fix incorrect buffer freeing when banners are used
- Hostname resolution works
- Various minor bugfixes/code size improvements etc

0.31 - Fri May 9 2003 17:57:16 +0800

- Improved syslog messages - IP logging etc
- Strip control characters from log messages (specified username currently)
- Login recording (utmp/wtmp) support, so last/w/who work - taken from OpenSSH
- Shell is started as a proper login shell, so /etc/profile etc is sourced
- Ptys work on Solaris (2.8 x86 tested) now
- Fixed bug in specifying the rsa hostkey
- Fixed bug in compression code, could trigger if compression resulted in
  larger output than input (uncommon but possible).

0.30 - Thu Apr 17 2003 18:46:15 +0800

- SECURITY: buffer.c had bad checking for buffer increment length - fixed
- channel code now closes properly on EOF - scp processes don't hang around
- syslog support added - improved auth/login/failure messages
- general code tidying, made return codes more consistent
- Makefile fixed for dependencies and makes libtomcrypt as well
- Implemented sending SSH_MSG_UNIMPLEMENTED :)

0.29 - Wed Apr 9 2003

- Fixed a stupid bug in 0.28 release, 'newstr = strdup(oldstr)',
  not 'newstr=oldstr'

0.28 - Sun Apr 6 2003

- Initial public release

Development was started in October 2002
