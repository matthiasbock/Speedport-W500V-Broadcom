/* LibTomMath, multiple-precision integer library -- Tom St Denis
 *
 * LibTomMath is library that provides for multiple-precision
 * integer arithmetic as well as number theoretic functionality.
 *
 * The library is designed directly after the MPI library by
 * Michael Fromberger but has been written from scratch with
 * additional optimizations in place.
 *
 * The library is free for all purposes without any express
 * guarantee it works.
