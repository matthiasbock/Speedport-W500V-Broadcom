Current:

Things which need doing:

- kexfollows
- check PRNG is good
- improved checking in DSS/RSA routines for valid sized keys etc
- check that there aren't timing issues with valid/invalid user authentication
  feedback.
- improve channel window adjustment algorithm

- inetd
- IP6 (binding to :: takes over ipv4 as well, sigh. If anyone wants to suggest
  a clean way (ie no V4MAPPED or setsockopt things) please let me know :)
- TCP forwarding (-L is done)

Features to add:

- PAM
- possible RSA blinding? need to check whether this is vuln to timing attacks
- CTR mode, SSH_MSG_IGNORE sending to improve CBC security
- DH Group Exchange possibly
