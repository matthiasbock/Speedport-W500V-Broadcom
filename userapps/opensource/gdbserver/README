README for GDBServer:

--> FILE LOCATIONS IN THE ORIGINAL TAR FILE:
- config.h and reg-mips.c file are generated by the configure application (see below)

- regdef.h: /gdb/regformats/
  gregset.h: /gdb/
  gdb_proc_service.h: /gdb/
  /gdb/signals.h: /include/gdb/

- Makefile is Broadcom proprietary file.

- All other files are from /gdb/gdbserver directory except /gdb/signals.h, which is in 
/include/gdb/ directory of the tar file.


--> GENERATING CONFIG.H AND REG-MIPS.C FILES FROM THE TAR FILE:
- Untar the source tar file. For example if the tar file is insight-6.1.tar.gz, then use:
	tar xvzf insight-6.1.tar.gz. 
This will create a directory insight-6.1

- Make a directory for the gdbserver and call it insight-6.1-mips in the place where the sources 
were untarred. So if the files were untarred in ~/insight then create this directory as 

~/insight-6.1-mips

- Change to the new directory: cd insight-6.1-mips

- Export some variables using
    	export CC=/opt/toochains/uclibc/bin/mips-uclibc-gcc
    	export LDFLAGS=-static

- Make the configuration file executable: chmod +x ../insight-6.1/gdb/gdbserver/configure

- Run the configure program to export some more variables: 
	../insight-6.1/gdb/gdbserver/configure --target=mips-linux

This procedure should have created config.h and reg-mips.c files in insight-6.1-mips directory.
